                        <h3>Georgia Tech 2025</h3>
                            <p>Hello! My name is Calvin Cheah and this year will mark my second year in college. My expected graduation date
                                is 2025 and I am a Computer Science major at Georgia Tech!</p>
                            <p>One unique thing that I'm passionate about is loneliness. Seeing individuals being lonely I feel is a rising problem and Something
                                that could easily be avoided. I like to try my best to help those that may feel this way.

                                I am also passionate in general social good and have a strong belief that a lot of people would have vastly improved lives if all humans
                                were willing to help eachother.</p>
